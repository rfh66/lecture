## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
k1*M+k2*N,
where M is max # of people per row
N is # rows
2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
k1*T, where T is total # of people
3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
Assuming number of people in row is constant, T=M*N:
k1*M+k2*N=k1*T=k1*M*N
k1*M=(k1*M-k2) N
N=(k1 M)/(k1 M - k2)
